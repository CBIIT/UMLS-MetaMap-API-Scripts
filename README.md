# UMLS-MetaMap-API-Scripts
# For everyday commits we use CIT/BRICS/Kevin’s repository – which is going to have contributors from BRICS, CBIIT, NEI, etc. 
# Once a month, before submitting the monthly report, we copy all relevant code from KA repository to our repository under CBIIT  (https://github.com/CBIIT/UMLS-MetaMap-API-Scripts)
