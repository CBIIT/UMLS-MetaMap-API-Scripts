As an input, the script takes the curated "NCIt concept lineage retrieval form EVS file.xls" file from nci-concept-lineage and generates a tree like structure 
(as a TXT file) where NCIt concepts and CUIs are presented as branches and common data elements as leaves.

After the curation of the retrieved CUIs from metamap-umls-to-vocabularies script which retrievs NCI (or choice of vocabulary mapping) CUIs for a given UMLS CUIs 
and after curating/editong the curated "NCIt concept lineage retrieval form EVS file.xls" file

we output a visualization to our NCI lineage via the tree .txt files. 

This is done by taking the multiple
COVID CDE file and parsing the data into .csv files. We then process each file by using only the 'CDE' and 
'NCIt Concept Lineage' columns. This involves two pre-processing steps, the first being that the 'CDE column' must be 
separated from the 'NCIt Concept Lineage' column. The latter column is processed so that we can use the delimiters to separate
parent from child and so forth. Once the file is restructured we are able to join our two files back together and allow
the tree algorithm to ingest each of the combined files and process them separately so that we can output individual .txt tree files
displaying the NCIt Concept Lineage like a tree. We are therefore also able to output an aggregated tree file which includes a tree output
from each of the tree files.
