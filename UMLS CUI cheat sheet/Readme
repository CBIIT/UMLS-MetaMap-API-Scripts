This folder if to store the “cheat sheet list” of UMLS concepts, 
which have been reviewed and approved by the curator as valid concepts for a given CDE project.
________________
One of MetaMap’s weakness, on which the MetaMap team is aware, 
is its inability to resolve UMLS Metathesaurus ambiguity, 
when two or more UMLS concepts share a common synonym. 
To solve that problem, in MetaMap has recently been incorporated word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithm, 
which resolves Metathesaurus ambiguity by choosing a concept having the most likely semantic type for a given context.
Unfortunately, in the specific case of mapping CDEs, 
their attributes do not always provide enough context, 
even when CDE definition (usually the longest chunk of text in a CDE) is included into mapping.
To address that problem, we found helpful to support the “cheat sheet list” of UMLS concepts, 
which have been reviewed and approved by the curator as valid concepts for a given CDE project. 
Having this cheat sheet helps selecting the right concept from the list returned by MetaMap.
